# Visual Cheat Detection System (Waldo_alpha_01)

**Advanced AI-powered cheat detection for Counter-Strike 2 gameplay footage**

This system uses cutting-edge Vision Transformer deep learning technology to analyze gameplay clips and detect potential cheating behavior from the footage. The current version is specific to CS2 and must use a user-trained model. 

---

## What This Does

- **Analyzes CS2 gameplay videos** - Upload your raw gameplay footage or individual clips
- **Focuses on killshots** - Automatically extracts 2-second clips by detecting headshots from gameplay audio
- **Trains locally from your footage** - Select your processed clips folder and train or fine-tune a model with labels (cheating) or (not cheating) 
- **Analyzes processed clips** - Provides detailed confidence scores from 0.0 (likely legitimate) to 1.0 (likely cheating) on clips 
- **Frame-by-frame analysis** - See exactly which 16 frames the model analyzed for each clip
- **Persistent results** - All analysis results are automatically saved and can be revisited later
- **Export capabilities** - Export results as JSON for further analysis

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide (Windows 11)

### Step 1: Download and Setup

1. **Download this project** to your computer (extract the ZIP)

2. **Run wsl-install.bat as admin** (not a virus trust me bro)
    Right click wsl-install.bat and click run as administrator. This will take a few minutes and will look frozen, but it's working in the background to install WSL. 

    Once the terminal auto-closes, reboot your PC and run wsl-install.bat as admin again and follow the prompts to set up a username and password. 

3. **Run wsl-setup.bat NOT as admin** 
    Double click wsl-setup.bat to run it without elevated privilages. This will auto-install the conda environment and all the requirements within the new WSL you just made. 


### Step 2: Prepare model for training/inferencing

1. **Download the model**
    Go to https://huggingface.co/jinggu/jing-model/blob/main/vit_g_ps14_ak_ft_ckpt_7_clean.pth and download the .pth file

2. **Place the model**

    Place this .pth file in the "deepcheat/VideoMAEv2" folder found in the extracted project files. Paste any other downloaded models in "deepcheat/VideoMAEv2/output" for inferencing or fine tuning. 

3. **You're ready to train a model and analyze CS2 clips!**


### Step 3: Run the Application

1. **Start the server**:
    Double click wsl-run.bat

2. **Open your web browser** and go to:
    http://localhost:5000

3. **Follow the steps** to train a model and analyze footage


## 🚀 Quick Start Guide (Linux)


1. **Paste this** in your terminal - Script isn't currently tested. If it doesn't work, make install.sh executable and run it. Then do the same for run.sh

```bash
echo "🚀 Starting Waldo installation..."

# Clone the repository
echo "📥 Downloading project from GitHub..."
git clone hhttps://github.com/waldo-vision/waldo.git
cd waldo

# Make install.sh executable and run it
echo "🔧 Installing dependencies..."
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

# Download the model file
echo "🤖 Downloading AI model (1.9GB - this will take a few minutes)..."
wget --show-progress -O deepcheat/vit_g_ps14_ak_ft_ckpt_7_clean.pth \
  https://huggingface.co/jinggu/jing-model/resolve/main/vit_g_ps14_ak_ft_ckpt_7_clean.pth

# Ask user if they want to run the server
echo ""
echo "✅ Installation complete!"
echo ""
read -p "Would you like to start the server now? (y/n): " -n 1 -r
echo ""
if [[ $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    echo "🌐 Starting server on http://localhost:5000"
    chmod +x run.sh
    ./run.sh
else
    echo "To start the server later, run: cd waldo&& ./run.sh"
fi
```

## 📖 How to Use

### 1. Process Raw Footage
- **Upload CS2 gameplay videos** (any format: MP4, AVI, etc.)
- The system automatically detects kill moments using audio analysis
- Extracts 2-second clips around each detected kill
- Any resolution should work, but 59.94 or 60p footage is recommended
- Currently you must remove spectator kills and proximity headshot kills manually

### 2. Train or Fine-Tune Models on Processed Clips
- **Label your clips** as "Cheater" or "Not Cheater" with the drop down selector
- **Train new models** or fine-tune existing ones with your clips (currently you need at least 48 processed clips to start training)
- **Real-time progress tracking** with detailed json logs
- As Mr. Homeless trains more accurate models, they will be made public here for free download https://www.patreon.com/basicallyhomeless and can be placed in the deepcheat/output/ folder for use

### 3. Test Clips for Cheating
- **Select clips to analyze** (from footage processed in step 1.)
- **Choose a trained model** for analysis
- **Get detailed results** including:
  - Confidence scores
  - Probability estimates using sigmoid transformation
  - Frame-by-frame analysis showing exactly what frames and ROI the model examined
  - Color-coded confidence categories

### 4. View Detailed Results
- **Comprehensive dashboard** with statistics and visualizations
- **Individual clip analysis** with video playback
- **Frame viewer** showing the exact 16 frames analyzed
- **Export capabilities** for sharing or further analysis

## 🔧 Technical Features

### Advanced Analysis
- **Vision Transformer architecture** with 1 billion parameters
- **Adaptive resolution scaling** - works on any video resolution (1080p, 1440p, 4K, etc.)
- **Smart frame selection** - analyzes frames 85-100 where killshots occur
- **Center crop focus** - concentrates on the crosshair area

- **No internet required** for analysis (only for initial setup)
- **Results stored locally** in the `evaluation_results` folder
- **Your data remains private** and under your control - no cloud connection needed

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- After training a new model or fine tuning a model, it may give an error code, but if it ran through the Epocs and trained, it did complete and the errors are likely not crucial to functioning. 

- If running this on Windows, it will run slightly slower and sometimes look frozen/won't have output. This is normal right now.

- Auto-clipping function Works for multiple audio streams, so if its not giving you 2 second clips, double check that the game audio is in the file and in-sync with the footage.
